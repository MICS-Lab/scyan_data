# Scyan data (auxiliary repository)

This repository contains public datasets used for the library `scyan`.

Note that this is **not** the main repository, which is actually hosted on Github [here](https://github.com/MICS-Lab/scyan).

## Automatic data loading

This repository has been created so that the main repository remains lightweight. If you need some of these datasets while using `scyan`, it will automatically load the data from this repository (i.e., no need to clone this repository to get the data).
